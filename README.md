# Domain Redirection Engine

I buy domains, especially when I'm the first to nab them when they appear on a TV show or book or documentation or something.

This is—at last—a universal monorepo on [Vercel](vercel.com) to redirect them all to where they should go, since I don't want to [build](chirpeo.com) all of them.
